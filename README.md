AICP Internship Task Week 6

Write and test a program or programs for the Wildlife Park:
Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data. Data
must be validated on entry.
All outputs, including error messages, need to be set out clearly and understandably.
All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.

Task 1 – displaying the ticket options and the extra attractions available
Set up your program to:
display the options, attractions and prices for one-day tickets
display the options, attractions and prices for two-day tickets
show the days available for booking; assume that there are tickets available for any valid
day.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Task 2 – process a booking
Extend your program for Task 1 to:
input the tickets and extra attractions required, then calculate the total cost of the booking
allocate a unique booking number
display the booking details, including the total cost and the unique booking number repeat
as required.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Task 3 – ensuring each booking is the best value
Check that the total for each booking gives the best value and offer an alternative if this is not
the case. For example, buying two family tickets is better than a group ticket for a group of 10
that includes four adults and six children.
